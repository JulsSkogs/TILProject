My version of the Today I Learned webapp built along with Jonas Schmedtmann's course.

This project makes use of Supabase, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and will be deployed using Netlify.

As I have been working through Jonas' Complete Javascript class, though I have finally started to get some project ideas churning in my head, every time I have considered starting them I've been left asking "well yeah, but how would I even do that?" As such, I'm hoping that working through a project from start to finish and seeing the development process at work will help me bridge the gap between all of the information I've worked with during the course and turning that into actual knowledge and ability.
